# MPilot Ground Control Station


*MPilot* is an intuitive and powerful ground control station (GCS) for UAVs.

The primary goal of MPilot is ease of use for both first time and professional users. 
It provides full flight control and mission planning for any MAVLink enabled drone, and vehicle setup for both PX4 and ArduPilot powered UAVs. 

All the code is open-source, so you can contribute and evolve it as you want.
